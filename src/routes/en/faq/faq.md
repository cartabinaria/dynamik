# GitHub Access

## How do I create an account?

To create an account, click the "_Login_" button in the top right corner. This will redirect you to GitHub, where you can select the **registration** option or simply **login using an existing account**.

You don't need to create a separate account for Resources: login happens directly through GitHub. By registering, you'll be able to use additional features like uploading documents and commenting on exercises and tests with [the Q&A system](Q&A-System).

## I forgot my password, what should I do?

No problem! Use GitHub's password recovery options that you can find [here](https://github.com/password_reset).

<!-- ## How do I upload a document?
Go to the appropriate section of the site and use the upload function. Make sure the file is in a supported format (PDF, Markdown, etc.) and doesn't exceed the maximum allowed size. -->

## I logged in but it doesn't show! What do I do?

Some browsers (Firefox, Brave) block third-party cookies, which are needed for GitHub login.  
Easy solutions:

- Enable third-party cookies in your browser settings
- Or try with Chrome or Edge

# Contributing

## How do I add a document?

It's very simple! Resources is a centralized system that relies on GitHub for content management. To add a document, you need to make a _pull request_ (PR) to CartaBinaria's GitHub repository. You can find all the detailed instructions in our wiki on [how to contribute to a course](https://cartabinaria.students.cs.unibo.it/wiki/raccolte-di-risorse/contribuire-a-un-insegnamento/).

If you need help, don't hesitate to contact us on our official channels, like the [Telegram channel](https://t.me/cartabinaria).

## What file formats are accepted?

GitHub prefers text files like Markdown (.md) or LaTeX (.tex) as they allow everyone to modify and add information directly to the file. These formats will then be automatically compiled into PDF by GitHub Actions to be displayed on this site.

However, you can also upload PDF files (.pdf); keep in mind though that these files can significantly increase the repository size.

To do this, I refer you to our wiki where you can find all the detailed instructions on [how to add a new course](https://cartabinaria.students.cs.unibo.it/wiki/raccolte-di-risorse/aggiungere-un-nuovo-insegnamento/).

# Administrators

## Who are the administrators?

Administrators are members of the CartaBinaria team who manage the site and content.
They have the highest role in the system and can make important changes and approve pull requests on the organization's GitHub repositories.

Here, on Resources, they have the task of approving documents prepared for Q&A, moderating discussions, and ensuring that community rules are respected.

## How can I become an administrator?

To become an administrator, you need to be an active member of the CartaBinaria community and demonstrate reliability and competence.
You can contact current administrators through CartaBinaria's official channels to express your interest. Here's the [link to the Telegram channel](https://t.me/cartabinaria).

# Q&A System

## How does the Q&A system work for exercises and tests?

This system, born internally at CartaBinaria as _Polleg_, is the system for managing questions and answers on PDF documents. You can ask questions, comment, or propose your solution on specific sections of the document and receive answers and comments from the community.

This way important contributions aren't lost and you can discuss the best solution together.

Questions are visually linked to the document through a bubble with a badge that tells you how many answers/comments are present for that section. Until you click on it, you have no _spoilers_ and you can consult the PDF without being influenced.

You might access a PDF file that hasn't been "prepared" for the Q&A system. In this case, after logging into the site, you can propose to CartaBinaria administrators a "prepared" version of the file for the Q&A system yourself. File preparation consists of breaking it into multiple parts (one for each question). When an administrator approves a proposal, that file will be available for the Q&A system.

## Can I edit or delete my answers?

Yes, you can delete your answers using the delete button that appears on answers you've written. Editing is not currently supported, but you can delete and rewrite an answer if necessary.
To avoid losing important contributions or comments to your comment, we decided to keep your answer with a **[deleted]** label: no one will be able to see the original content or know who wrote it, except administrators for moderation purposes.

## Can I reply anonymously?

Yes, when writing an answer you can choose the "Post anonymously" option to hide your profile picture and GitHub username. Remember though that for security reasons and CartaBinaria protection, your GitHub account will still remain linked to your answer in the database, even if it won't be publicly visible.

## How does the voting system work for answers?

You can vote on answers using the up arrow (upvote) or down arrow (downvote). Votes help identify the most useful and accurate answers for the community.

# Other

## How do I report inappropriate content?

Contact the system administrators through official channels if you find inappropriate content or content that violates community rules.
